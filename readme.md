# 🚀 IndiaBix Auto-Clicker Extension Guide

## What This Extension Does

This extension automatically clicks the "X" button on popups asking you to disable your adblocker, saving you from the annoyance of manually closing these prompts!

## 🔧 Installation Guide

### Step 1: Load the Extension

1. Open Chrome and type `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar
2. Toggle ON the "Developer mode" switch in the top-right corner
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button
4. Navigate to the `autoclicker` folder and select it
5. You should see our extension appear in your extensions list! 🎉

### Step 2: Add an Adblocker (Important!)

IndiaBix shows many pop-up ads that can interfere with the autoclicker. We recommend installing an adblocker:

1. Visit the [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) page in Chrome Web Store
2. Click "Add to Chrome"
3. Follow the prompts to complete installation

**Alternative Adblockers:**

- [AdBlock Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb)
- [AdGuard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adguard-adblocker/bgnkhhnnamicmpeenaelnjfhikgbkllg)

## 🎮 Using the Extension

1. Visit any IndiaBix quiz page (e.g., [https://www.indiabix.com/aptitude/questions-and-answers/](https://www.indiabix.com/aptitude/questions-and-answers/))
2. Click on the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
3. Watch as the extension automatically closes "Please disable adblocker" popups

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**If the extension isn't working:**

1. Make sure both the autoclicker and adblocker are enabled
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Verify you're on an IndiaBix page
4. Check the console (F12) for any error messages

**If popups still appear:**

- Check that your adblocker is properly configured
- Consider trying a different adblocker from the list above

## 📝 Notes for Learners
